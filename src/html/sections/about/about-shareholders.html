                                    With the population growth in South Asia and Africa the demand

                                    billion by 2030. This will require around 90 million additional
                                    hectares of land to grow soybeans.

                                    are cultivated mostly under subsistence agriculture. This
                                    creates a big potential for development of growing new crops.
